# Exploring and analyzing U.S. Department of Education data

The U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) gathers school level data across the nation. In this project, I've written a few Python scripts to explore and analyze the 2013-14 CRDC dataset at a high level.

## Files

| File/ Folder name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [data](data) | Folder containing the 2013-14 CRDC data and documentation |
| [enrollment.py](enrollment.py) | Python script to calculate the percentage student enrollment by race and gender |
| [environment.yml](environment.yml) | Project environment required to run this code |
| [exploration.py](exploration.py) | Python script to create pivot tables for data exploration |
| [findings.txt](findings.txt) | Text file summarizing the outcomes of the analysis |
| [read.py](read.py) | Python script to explore the 2013-14 CRDC csv file describing the contents |

## Setup

- You must have [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed to run this code.
- Create a conda environment using [environment.yml](environment.yml) YAML file. More help on this can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html#use-environment-from-file).
